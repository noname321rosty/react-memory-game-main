Implement logic and UI for Mahjong-like game.
The objective of the game is to collect cards until no card is hidden. User picks a
card and if its value matches the value of a previously selected card, both cards
change state to “visible”.
Any card can have a value in (1,50) range and must be a prime number.
No two pairs with identical values are allowed. Array of prime numbers should be
generated dynamically.
Layout should be made in 8px grid. The project should contain a wrapper
component, a card component and a service to generate an array of pairs.
Would be a plus if some or all of the listed technologies are used: css-grid, redux,
flow/typescript, scss
You can look at the example in the following video
Mahjong demo
The results are accepted not later than one day after the date of sending the letter
with the assignment. In case of any bugs, you may be asked to make some changes
to the code.
